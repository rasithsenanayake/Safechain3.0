# Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing

This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the front-end interface. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.


## Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** Images are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
- **Smart Contract:** Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management.
- **File History:** Users can track the files behaviour even thought the content and the file name is changed.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
- **React:** Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.


### Usage

Once the setup and configuration are complete, follow these steps to utilize the decentralized image upload and sharing system:

1. **Install Metamask:**
   - Ensure Metamask is installed and configured in your browser for Ethereum interactions.

2. **Update Contract Address:**
   - After smart contract deployment, make sure to update the contract address in `App.js` within the React application.

3. **Npm i for :**
   - After smart contract deployment, make sure to update the contract address in `App.js` within the React application.

4. **Update Contract Address:**
   - After smart contract deployment, make sure to update the contract address in `App.js` within the React application.

These steps will ensure smooth navigation and utilization of the system while maintaining access control and avoiding potential errors.
